      <td><b><a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/">Sergey Levine </a></b> ​is an Associate Professor at the University of California Berkeley and leads the Robotic AI and Learning Lab in the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR). His research is focused on learning algorithms to acquire complex behaviors, especially general-purpose methods that could enable any autonomous system to learn to solve any task. His work has investigated a wide variety of RL problems, from representation learning to skill embeddings and offline RL. He received his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University advised by Vladlen Koltun.

      <td><b><a href="https://talkingtorobots.com/yonatanbisk.html">Yonatan Bisk </a></b> ​is an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon's Language Technologies Institute. His group works on grounded and embodied natural language processing, placing perception and interaction central to language learning and understanding. His work has explored sidestepping rewards for learning agents by leveraging language grounding along with expert demonstrations. Previously, he received his PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign working on unsupervised Bayesian models of syntax, before spending time at USC's ISI (working on grounding), the University of Washington (for commonsense research), and Microsoft Research (for vision+language).

      <td><b><a href="https://neo-x.github.io/">Glen Berseth </a></b> ​is an assistant professor at the Université de Montréal, a core academic member of the Mila - Quebec AI Institute, Canada CIFAR AI chair, member l'Institute Courtios, and co-director of the Robotics and Embodied AI Lab (REAL). His current research focuses on machine learning and solving real-world sequential decision-making problems (planning/RL), such as robotics, scientific discovery and adaptive clean technology. The specifics of this research has covered the areas of human-robot collaboration, generalization, reinforcement learning, continual learning, meta-learning, multi-agent learning, and hierarchical learning. He also teaches courses on data science and robot learning at Université de Montréal and Mila, covering the most recent research on machine learning techniques for creating generalist agents.
